# Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Algorithms: an Experimental Evaluation
Frank-Wolfe algorithms occupy a unique position in constrained optimization, as they alleviate both the objective function and the constrained set's computational burdens.
In this project, my colleagues and I built from scratch and evaluated two state-of-the-art Frank Wolfe algorithms using a â„“1-ball constraint.

### Repository material
- _Frank-Wolfe-report_, a report of the work done;
- _Frank-Wolfe-code_, the code containing the implementations and the evaluations;
- _Papers_, a folder containing the three papers studied to implement the algorithms.
